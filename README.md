# The Terminal at Midnight

This is my Choose Your Own Adventure project for Web Development IV.  
The goal was to practice using **GitHub Flow** (branches, pull requests, merges) while also building a short branching story in Markdown.

## 🌌 The Story

The adventure begins in a silent subway terminal, under a flickering sign that reads *LAST TRAIN*.  
From here the reader makes choices: wait by the gates, board the empty train, check the information desk, or wander into the locker room.  
Each choice opens a new path — some continue the mystery, some end abruptly, and others open further branches.

All story content is written in simple Markdown files, with links connecting the pages so the reader can keep exploring.

## 🛠️ How I Worked

Since this was meant to be a group assignment, I simulated a team by creating multiple branches with different “member” names.  
Each branch added or edited part of the story, and then I opened pull requests, reviewed them, and merged them back into `main`.  
This created a realistic workflow history that shows all five stages:

1. **Setup** → repo created, `intro.md` added.  
2. **Expand** → branches created, choices and new story pages added.  
3. **Review** → pull requests reviewed and merged, conflicts resolved.  
4. **Edit** → small edits and extra pages added on new branches.  
5. **Finalize** → all branches merged into `main`, repo cleaned and ready to submit.

## 📸 Screenshots & Workflow

Detailed step-by-step screenshots are included in [`WORKFLOW.md`](WORKFLOW.md).  
They show each stage (commits, branches, PRs, merges, and final repo).
